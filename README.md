# Hello, I'm Iago

They call me **devlongen** (comes from my last name).

This profile is my little corner to share personal projects, ideas, and learnings in the world of technology.  
But the focus here is **not about productivity or self-help for devs** – it's about **curiosity, creativity, and the will to learn**.

## Who am I?

I'm from **Joinville/SC, Brazil**, I'm **20 years old**, and I've been immersed in the internet since I was **7**.  
I've always been deeply into the gaming world – I’ve played a bit of everything: **GTA RP, Rocket League, LoL**...

Yes, I’m the kind of **geek** who loves both building PCs and reading about black holes.

Lately, I’ve been very interested in the lives of **renowned physicists** and their contributions.  
I study on my own, hoping to one day **leave a positive mark on the world** as well.

## Tech Area

I'm currently at the beginning of my dev journey, still looking for opportunities as an **intern**.

I’ve built a solid theoretical foundation and am now getting hands-on with personal projects:

### Ongoing Projects:

- **Ajex**: a tool for cleaning and manipulating structured data through spreadsheets.  
  > The idea is to make life easier for those who work with data, turning spreadsheets into something functional with just a few clicks.

- **Realistic Physics Car Simulator**:  
  An ambitious project where I aim to apply real-world physics concepts to simulate car performance (still in early development).

### Currently Learning:

- **Languages**:  
  `C++` • `Python`

- **Focus**:
  - Building real-world tools
  - Clean code structure and logic
  - Physics simulations and data manipulation

You can follow my projects right here in the repositories.
