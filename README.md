# Hello, I'm Iago

They call me **longen** (comes from my last name).

This profile is my little corner to share personal projects, ideas, and learnings in the world of technology.  
But the focus here is **not about productivity or self-help for devs** – it's about **curiosity, creativity, and the will to learn**.

## Who am I?

I'm from **Joinville/SC, Brazil**, I'm **20 years old**, and I've been immersed in the internet since I was **7**.  
I've always been deeply into the gaming world – I’ve played a bit of everything: **GTA RP, Rocket League, LoL**...

Yes, I’m the kind of **geek** who loves both building PCs and reading about black holes.

Lately, I’ve been very interested in the lives of **renowned physicists** and their contributions.  
I study on my own, hoping to one day **leave a positive mark on the world** as well.
